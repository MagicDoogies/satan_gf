No time for reminiscing right now. Eldwin is waiting for you outside.

Your bed is the ultimate symbol of 'comfy'. You want to do nothing more than slide under those sheets and slip back into the warmth of those heavenly blankets.

These slippers are very old and matted down from use. 
However none of the new slippers you bought and tried were nearly as good at retaining heat or as comfortable to wear.
So they remain. Utility ranks slightly above fashion.

Vixent had a grub infestation in their studio so you let him work on his new sculpts in your room.
It was a great way to get to know them better.
They did the sculpting while you did the painting. 
You can't quite remember why they remind you of the smell of wetlands though.

Your 'Giga Bean Bag' is also known as the 'Goblin Couch' due to the ever increasing pile of dirty clothes thrown on it,
the zero fucks you have eating messy food there, and the couple time you and Eldwin spend on it.

...You remind yourself (for real this time) to get a much needed hamper and trash can for your room.

8:57 p.m? That's definitely incorrect. 
The power must of went out again last night. 
You make a note to correct the time after your date (and a nap).

You're proud of yourself for finally getting around to organizing the notes from your study into a neat and chronological pile.
